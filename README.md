## About me

![Portrait of me](portrait.png)

My name is Luca Schultz and I am the person behind the pseudonym locxter. As a technology enthusiast from Nothern Germany I love to tinker and find new ways of doing stuff. In my 8 years of programming and doing electronics projects I have slowly found love for writing simple and clean yet effective code, doing every part of a project I reasonably can on my own and using privacy respecting as well as FOSS software.

I am currently working with **C++** and **Java** as my primary programming languages, FreeCAD for designing parts, Inkscape for creating vector graphics and VSCodium as my text editor as well as IDE. My desktop operating system is Debian while I run LineageOS on my phone.
